COMPILING:
	The program archive contains a makefile
	Simply type 'make' into the terminal after extracting the archive to compile the program
	The final executable is named 'line_processor'

EXECUTING/CLEANUP:
	The program is executed by typing './line_processor'
	Since input is read from stdin, the program may also be executed with './line_processor < inputfile.txt' 

	In order to remove the executable/object files from the directory, type 'make clean'
